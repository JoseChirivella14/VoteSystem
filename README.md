Create an API using Rails for a voting application. You will need the following resources:

## api/v1/candidates
* attributes: name, party, maybe more
* index action
* show action
## api/v1/voters
* attributes: name, party, maybe more
* create action
* show action (with auth to show you are the voter)
* update action (with auth to show you are the voter)
## api/v1/votes
* attributes: voter (unique), candidate
* create (with auth)
* **bonus**: index action that shows candidates and number of votes for each
## **Bonus**: api/v1/seats
* attributes: name
* has_many candidates
* has_many votes
* votes are now unique for voter and seat
